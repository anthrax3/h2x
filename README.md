# SVGR

**SVGR** is a tool to convert raw SVG into React components.

## Why?

React supports SVG out of the box, it's simpler, easier and much more powerful to
have a component instead of an SVG file. Wrapped in React components, your SVG are
inlined in the page and you can style it using CSS.

A lot of projects are trying to solve this problem.

Using raw node:

- https://github.com/publitas/svg-to-react
- https://github.com/quirinpa/svg-2-react-isvg
- https://github.com/egoist/svg-to-component
- https://github.com/mapbox/svg-react-transformer
- https://github.com/andgandolfi/svg-to-react-k

Using command line:

- https://github.com/goopscoop/svg-to-react-cli
- https://github.com/meriadec/svg2react
- https://github.com/mapbox/svg-react-transformer-writer
- https://github.com/joshblack/react-svg-converter

Or using a Webpack loader:

- https://github.com/jhamlet/svg-react-loader
- https://github.com/mapbox/svg-react-transformer-loader

Or using a browserify loader:

- https://github.com/coma/svg-reactify

Or using gulp / grunt plugin:

- https://github.com/marvin1023/gulp-svg-to-react

Or at runtime:

- https://github.com/tonis2/svg-react
- https://github.com/quirinpa/react-isvg-loader/blob/master/index.js
- https://github.com/MoOx/react-svg-inline

Or using grunt:

- https://github.com/okcoker/grunt-svg-react-component
- https://github.com/sairion/svg-inline-react

I think it's enough, the goal of this library is to try to do it right once for all.
